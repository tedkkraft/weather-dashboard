# weather-dashboard
A weather dashboard that runs in the browser and uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities. 

Enter a city into the searchbar to get the city's current weather and *5-day forecast.

***This application is not fully functional. I ran into a roadblock creating the 5 day forecast.
